## Design Principles
1. **Own my content.** It's a divorce of sorts, allowing of course for cross-posting to the socials of the day. But ultimately, I don't want the first showing to be Mark's voracious algorithm. 
2. **Accessibility and performance first.** I don't want to sacrifice the quality of the imagery to the bandwidth gods. I also want full accessibility to be a first-class principleâ€”which means full keyboard and assistive technology catered to from the get-go.
3. **Play and learn.** As @fchimero so clearly articulates, [everything is hard again](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2018/everything-easy/) as it inevitably becomes so again and again every few years. I want a playground wherein I can toy betwixt the new and the foundational.
